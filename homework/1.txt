This is my first entry and it contains each known coding triplet.
DNA is polimer molecule with famous double-stranded helix shape. 
There are four monomeres (nucleotides) types inside DNA molecule -- Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G) and Cytosine.
Normally Adenine binds only to Thymine of opposite helix strand, and Guanine binds only to Cytosine (Chargaff's rule).
Transcription occurs on a single-stranded DNA molecule during early stages of mitotic ("basic") cell division.
RNA polymerase, special kind of enzyme, attaches itself to a single-stranded DNA molecule and creates it's mirror reflection 
in a shape of single-stranded RNA molecule. Instead of Thymine, RNA contains different nucleotide called Uracil (U)
Three consequent nucleotides on a single strand of RNA recognized as triplet. During the translation process which occures in 
ribosome on later stages of cell division, ribosome "parces" through ssRNA, reads this triplets and synthesizes chain of amino 
acids known as polypeptide. After the propper folding and other modifications this polypeptide becomes prothein.
