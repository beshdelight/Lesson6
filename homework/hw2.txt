It is known that triplet code is a bit excessive - there are 64 possible combinations
but only 20 aminoacids (known also as "essential amino acids"). 
There are additional triplets that signalize about the start of polypeptide synthesis (start-codone)
and about stopping it (stop-codone).
Here are the list of mentioned aminoacids. 
Alanine		Cysteine 	Histidine	Methionine	Threonine
Arginine	Glutamic acid	Isoleucine	Phenylalanine	Tryptophan 
Asparagine	Glutamine 	Leucine		Proline		Tyrosine 
Aspartic Acid	Glycine		Lysine		Serine 		Valine
